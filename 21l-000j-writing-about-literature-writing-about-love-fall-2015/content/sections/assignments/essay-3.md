_Benito Cereno_ or _Woman Hollering Creek_ or _This Is How You Lose Her_
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**To be included in End-of-Semester Portfolio**

This writing prompt is for the final essay of the course, Final Essay 3. You will prepare a project proposal and final essay (750 words, minimum) on one of the following texts: _Benito Cereno_, _Woman Hollering Creek_, or _This Is How You Lose Her_.

Part of this assignment will require intensive research so, the sooner you select your text and read it then the sooner you can begin organizing your secondary sources and including them into the conversation of your essay. There must be 5 **secondary sources** included in this final essay. Some of which you will quote passages from, others from which you will paraphrase from, or even those that you might only select phrases from. You might include for a secondary source another text for comparative analysis (juxtaposing _Woman Hollering Creek_ and T_his Is How You Lose Her_ thus counts as two sources, or writing about _Benito Cereno_ in parallel to _Beloved_ also counts as two sources). Remember: one literary text must always remain the primary text of your research project.

First, select a primary text: _Benito Cereno_, _Woman Hollering Creek_, or _This Is How You Lose Her_.

Second, for the critical sources that you select, think about how you intend to define your project. What is it about your primary text that you are most interested in and excited to examine? (Also, allow your field of study to guide the project, that is, if you see its connection with the literary texts we are reading. For instance, when I teach Walt Whitman, my engineers gravitate towards his language for how the tone sounds scientific – Whitman wrote on the technological advances of the mid to late nineteenth century). This is all to pose a larger question: How will you define the **literary criticism** that you will perform in your writing of that primary text?

**Literary Criticism**

Thus far we have examined several literary approaches in the course of the semester:

| Narrator | (_Gatsby_ and _Waitress_) |
| Character | (_Gatsby_ and _Waitress_) |
| Autobiographical | (_Fun Home_) |
| The Archive | (_Beloved_) |
| New Historicism | (_Benito Cereno_) |
| Feminist Analysis | (_Woman Hollering Creek_) |
| Cultural Analysis | (_This Is How You Lose Her_) 

For the previous writing assignment on _Fun Home_ or _Beloved_, I asked that each of you define your project according to the following terms:

*   Historical Approach
*   Literary Reading
*   Author & Narrative Strategy
*   Author Project
*   Specific Theme
*   Theoretical Approach

Now, for the final essay, I want to provide you another list. We will talk about this list on session 19, though take a glance at it beforehand. The list is a more **general introduction** to the field of **literary criticism** and its more expansive possibilities. Essentially, for the final essay, you will select one of the forms of criticism below – each actually expands upon the previous list above yet _this list is not as informal_.

**Formalist Criticism**

Intense, close literary reading and step-by-step analysis to understand how various elements in a literary text work together to shape its dynamic effects on the reader

**Biographical Criticism**

Understanding an author’s life to then understand more thoroughly the literary text and explicate its layers yet does not let the _life_ of the author distort the _work_

**Historical Criticism**

An investigation of a literary work by examining the social, cultural, and intellectual context that produced it

**Gender Criticism**

An examination of how sexual identity influences the production of a literary work by turning to the work of feminists, which could include sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists – for instance, examining representations of women and men, explore author’s gender influences, consider structures of literature created by women

**Psychological Criticism**

Examining psychoanalytic theories to explore behavior of characters, such as sexuality, the unconscious, and repression

**Sociological Criticism**

Examining literature in the specific context in which it was written, or the historical setting of the text, both of which consider the cultural, economic, and political context, in addition to exploring the relationship between the artist and society

**Mythological Criticism**

Examination of literature through individual imaginative uses of myths and symbols specific to different cultures and epochs

**Deconstructionist Criticism**

Focus on how texts do not have a fixed or single meaning, and also, concentrate on studying how language is being used in the text

**Reader-Response Criticism**

Attempt to describe what happens in the reader’s mind while interpreting a text, while traditional criticism assumes that imaginative writing is the creative act, reader-response theory acknowledges how reading is its own creative process

**Portfolio**

As stated in the syllabus, on the last day of class you will submit a portfolio that will include your final essays—Essay 1, Essay 2, and Essay 3—in addition to a statement of reflection on your experience as a writer (also optional is the extra credit assignment that is to be included in the portfolio as well).
