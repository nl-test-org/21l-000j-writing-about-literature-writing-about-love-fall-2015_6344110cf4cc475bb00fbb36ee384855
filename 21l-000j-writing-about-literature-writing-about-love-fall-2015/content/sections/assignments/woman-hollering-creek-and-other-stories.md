This writing assignment, like the others, is a short and focused exercise in _close reading_. Only 250 words are required; however, this is enough room for you to work on a short story in _Woman Hollering Creek_ and in _detail_. Select one short story from the collection and concentrate on a passage that you deem interesting. Place the passage at the top of the page as an epigraphic quotation. Then, examine it and analyze it as you have done with previous close reading assignments.

My advice: **Stay focused with the epigraphic quotation**. I am asking that you craft one paragraph as a **body paragraph** that you might insert into a longer essay. (If for your final essay you select Cisneros, there is one paragraph). The objective is to develop a _sustained textual analysis_ with a scene/moment.

Spend one-day **drafting** (an hour +), the second day **rewriting** (an hour +) and possibly a third day **polishing** (an hour). Your writing is improving! And it is exciting to watch that improvement and read your work.
